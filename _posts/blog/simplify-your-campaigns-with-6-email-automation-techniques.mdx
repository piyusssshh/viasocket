Email marketing is a powerful tool for businesses to connect with their audience, but managing email campaigns can be time-consuming and complex. This is where workflow automation comes in handy. By setting up automated workflows, tasks such as sending welcome emails to new subscribers, scheduling regular newsletters, and segmenting email lists based on user behavior can be done automatically.Furthermore, workflow automation enables businesses to deliver more personalized and targeted email campaigns. Automated workflows can trigger emails based on specific actions taken by subscribers, such as website visits, email opens, or purchases. This personalized approach not only improves engagement rates but also drives conversions and builds stronger customer relationships.

## 1. Add all your leads into your subscriber’s list

Let’s say you collect information from people interested in your products or services through forms on **Typeform** or **Google Forms**. You want to make sure this data goes straight into your email marketing tool like **Mailchimp** or **MailerLite** so you can reach out to these potential customers easily. This is where a workflow automation tool like viaSocket comes into play.Whenever someone fills out a form, viaSocket automatically grabs their information and sends it straight to your email marketing tool. With this setup, you can focus on creating engaging email campaigns in your email marketing tool, knowing that your automation tool has taken care of importing all your lead data seamlessly.

## 2. Segment your email list based on various criteria

Segmenting your subscribers into different email lists is a crucial aspect of email marketing automation. It involves dividing your email list into smaller, more targeted groups based on specific criteria such as demographics, interests, behaviors, or past interactions with your brand. This segmentation allows you to send more personalized and relevant content to each group, which can lead to higher engagement and conversion rates.For example, you can send product recommendations to customers who have previously made purchases, or special promotions to subscribers who have shown interest but haven't made a purchase yet. When subscribers receive emails that are relevant to their needs and interests, they are more likely to open, read, and interact with them.

## 3. Create re-engagement campaigns for inactive subscribers 

Over time, some subscribers may become disengaged or stop interacting with your emails altogether. However, with the right re-engagement campaigns in place, you can reconnect with these subscribers and reignite their interest in your brand. Once you've segmented your inactive subscribers, viaSocket enables you to set up trigger-based workflows that send targeted emails to inactive subscribers, such as a personalized re-engagement email offering a special discount or incentive to return. Even if they don't immediately convert, re-engagement efforts can keep your brand top-of-mind for when they're ready to buy.

Personalized content is key to successful email marketing campaigns. It allows you to connect with your subscribers on a deeper level by delivering content that resonates with their interests, preferences, and behaviors. With the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), businesses can now leverage AI-powered tools to create highly personalized content at scale. When subscribers receive content that speaks directly to their interests and needs, they are more likely to take action, whether it's making a purchase, signing up for a webinar, or downloading a resource. Personalized content can drive higher conversion rates and ultimately, increase revenue.

Automating transactional emails not only saves time and resources but also ensures timely and consistent communication with your customers. viaSocket enables you to personalize transactional emails with dynamic content based on customer information or order details.
