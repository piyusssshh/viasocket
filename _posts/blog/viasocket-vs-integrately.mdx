## 6. viaSocket counts 30 seconds of flow execution as one invocation, whereas Integrately counts each Action you set up as One Task<a id="6-viasocket-counts-30-seconds-of-flow-execution-as-one-invocation-whereas-integrately-counts-each-action-you-set-up-as-one-task"></a>

This means that irrespective of the number of actions within the workflow, if the execution time falls within a 30-second window, it will be considered as one invocation. This approach allows users to optimize their workflows for efficiency without worrying about excessive invocation charges for short executions.

On the other hand, Integrately counts each action set up within a workflow as one task. As a result, users may encounter higher task counts depending on the complexity and number of actions within their workflows.

For example, if you have a workflow in Integrately that saves any attachments from the email to a specified folder in Dropbox for each new Email received on Gmail and notifies you about it on Slack, it's counted as two tasks.

So, if you receive 50 emails on Gmail in a day, and each email triggers this workflow, then it will be counted as 50\*2= 100 tasks.

On the other hand, viaSocket counts 30 second flow execution as 1 invocation. The same workflow discussed above will be counted as 50 invocations in viaSocket which is way more affordable than Integrately.
